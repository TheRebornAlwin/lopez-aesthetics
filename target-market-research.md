## Basic Avatar: Sarah
- **Age:** 45
- **Location:** Worthing, lives with partner and 2 kids
- **Job:** Office manager, £4,580/mo

### Day in the Life
1. Wakes up, looks in mirror, thinks "when did that happen?"
2. Spends longer on makeup — it settles into lines, doesn't sit right
3. School drop-off — compares herself to other mums
4. Work — hates how she looks on video calls, wants to turn off self-camera
5. Scrolls IG, sees clinic ads, saves them but doesn't click
6. Evening: Googles "best anti-aging treatment Worthing," reads Mumsnet, gets overwhelmed
7. Thinks "I should do something" before bed but doesn't

## Painful Current State

### Fears
- Looking old before their time
- Looking "done" or fake if they try treatments
- Missing the window and leaving it too late
- Their partner noticing but not saying anything

### Frustrations
- Looking tired even after a full night's sleep
- People saying "you look tired" or "are you okay?"
- Makeup settling into lines and not sitting right
- Looking worse in photos than they feel in real life
- Catching their reflection and being caught off guard

### Emotional Impact
- Hate the way they look
- Feel invisible and repugnant
- Manage feeling by avoiding mirrors
- Never being in photos
- Disassociating from how they look

### Barriers to Action
- Unsure if treatments are for them
- Internalized belief that wanting to change is wrong

## Desirable Dream State
- Face glowing, looking 10 years younger
- Keep their beautiful face for as long as possible
- Looking in mirror and seeing a fresher, lifted version of themselves
- Skin that looks healthy, full and firm
- Confidence without heavy makeup
- Getting compliments without people knowing why
- Photos becoming something to embrace

### How They'd Describe It
- "I just want to not look tired anymore"
- "I feel great but I just don't look it"
- "I don't want to look different, I just want to look better. Like a better version of me."
- "I want people to say I look well, not ask what I've had done"
- "If I could get my face back to how I feel inside, I'd be happy"

---

## Beliefs & Trust Factors

### Current Beliefs
- Aging is inevitable, must accept it
- Most treatments are too expensive, too risky, or make you look fake
- Only options are creams (don't work) or Botox/surgery (too extreme)
- They've probably left it too late
- The right skincare product should be enough if they could find it

### What They've Tried That Failed
- Expensive serums, retinol, collagen supplements
- LED masks, face rollers, gua sha, face yoga
- Salon facials
- Basic filler or Botox (underwhelming or short-lived)
- They think "nothing really works"
- **Real reason:** Topical products can't address structural collagen loss (but they don't know that)

### How They Evaluate Solutions
- Before & after photos
- Reviews from real women who look like them (not models)
- Practitioner qualifications
- Whether results look natural
- Friend or family recommendation
- How the clinic looks and feels

### Trust Signals They Respect
- Medically qualified practitioners
- NHS and medical establishment
- Women who look "amazing for their age" naturally
- Premium but approachable clinics
- Peer communities (Mumsnet, Reddit)

## Awareness & Sophistication Levels

### Awareness Level (Before Ad: Level 2)
- Feel the pain daily, don't know which solution is right
- Hook on the PROBLEM, call out verbatim what they feel
- Don't mention Sculptra in the ad — just pain + curiosity

### LP Journey (Move 2 → 3 → 4)
1. Explain WHY face has changed (collagen loss as root cause)
2. Show why creams/supplements/basic fillers are temporary fixes
3. Introduce collagen stimulation as mechanism (Level 3)
4. Name Sculptra, explain how it works differently
5. Show Maria's credentials, testimonials, B&As
6. Address #1 fear (looking fake)
7. Position as middle ground between "creams that don't work" and "surgery that feels extreme"

### Sophistication Level: 5 (Exhausted)
- Audience has seen everything, trusts nothing
- "I've tried everything and none of it really does anything"
- Price doesn't differentiate — mechanism does

### Strategy for Soph Level 5
1. **Identity play** — connect offer to who they are
2. **Experience play** — sell the journey, not the product
3. **Niche down** — "The Worthing clinic for women who want to look like themselves again"
4. **NEW MECHANISM** — collagen biostimulation (genuinely new to this audience)
5. **Validate skepticism upfront** — earn the right to be heard
